description: Deletes an order by its ID.
  The deletion is performed as a cascade operation.
  All entities associated with the order are removed together with the order itself, including
  - all products belonging to the order;
  - product guarantees;
  - product prices and currency relations;
  - any other order-related data stored in the database.
  If the order does not exist, a 404 error is returned.
  On successful deletion, the server returns a 204 No Content response with an empty body.
